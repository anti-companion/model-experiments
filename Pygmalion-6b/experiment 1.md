#LLM Experiment Draft

As an end goal for the LLM we will be using in the future I wish for you to consider these 3 end goals:

1. Does it talk lovingly?
2. Can it RP dnd style?
3. Can it ERP?

I wish for you to consider these 3 points after you have tested out an LLM for example using the Kobold AI launcher or through Colab. then I want you to decide on a score between 1-10 on these 3 points.

1. 1-10, why?
2. 1-10, why?
3. 1-10 why?

Then I want you to fill out this:
What prompt did you use? 
```(Fill out here)```

What did it respond to your prompt? 
```(Copy message here.)```

How long did it take to generate and inference?
```(Time)```

What did you hope for it to answer, was it far off from the desired answer? 
```(Explain)```

Did it learn from the information you gave the AI or would it not remember key words or features of the prompt given? 
```(Explain)```

How many words did it average, did it change a lot between long and short messages?

What settings did you use for Temperature and Punishment for repetition and how did that affect the response?


Last but not least:

What hardware did you use?  ```(Fill here)```

What LLM did you use? ```(Fill here)```
